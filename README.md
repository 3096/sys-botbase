# sys-botbase based on jakibakis sys-netcheat
The purpose of this sys-module is to allow users to remote control their switch via wifi connection as well as to read and write to a games memory. This can be used to create bots for games and other fun automation projects.

## Warning:
Don't even think of blaming me if anything goes wrong with you using this. It's supposed to help you in the development of bot automation, but I am not liable for any damages or bans you might get in the process. Use at your own risk and all that.
